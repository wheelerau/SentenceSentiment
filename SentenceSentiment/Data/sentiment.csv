So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.,0
Great for the jawbone.,1
The mic is great.,1
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.,0
And the sound quality is great.,1
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.,1
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,0
Very good quality though,1
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,1
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,0
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,0
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!,1
The commercials are the most misleading.,0
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.,1
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.,0
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.,1
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.,1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,0
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.,0
Doesn't hold charge.,0
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.,1
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.,0
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.,0
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended,1
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.,0
It has kept up very well.,1
Poor Talk Time Performance.,0
The case is great and works fine with the 680.,1
worthless product.,0
I was not impressed by this product.,0
Nice headset priced right.,1
I only hear garbage for audio.,0
Excellent bluetooth headset.,1
It has all the features I want,1
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.,0
This case seems well made.,1
Disappointed with battery.,0
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,0
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,1
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.,1
I love this thing!,1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,1
VERY DISAPPOINTED.,0
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!,1
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.,1
The buttons for on and off are bad.,0
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.,0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.,0
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,0
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.,1
Great for iPODs too.,1
Mic Doesn't work.,0
Great choice!,1
Nice docking station for home or work.,1
This is a beautiful phone.,1

The construction of the headsets is poor.,0

The ear buds only play music in one ear.,0
Will order from them again!,1
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.,0
I found this product to be waaay too big.,0
I'm very disappointed with my decision.,0
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.,1
Definitely a bargain.,1
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.,1
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,0
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,0
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.,1
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.,1
Absolutely great.,1
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.,1
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.,0
It is very comfortable on the ear.,1
It has been a winner for us.,1
Setup couldn't have been simpler.,1
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.,1
Could not get strong enough signal.,0
Iam very pleased with my purchase.,1
Bad Quality.,0
Gets the job done.,1
Basically the service was very bad.,0
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,0
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.,1
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.,1
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.,1
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.,0
Very good stuff for the price.,1
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,0
Voice recognition is tremendous!,1
What a waste.,0
I was not happy with this item.,0
very disappointed.,0
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.,0
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.,1
What a waste of time!,0
Its reception is very very poor.,0
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.,0
I Was Hoping for More.,0
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!,1
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.,0
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.,1
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!,1
And I just love the colors!,1
W810i is just SUPERB.,1
Great charger.,1
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.,0
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.,1
Great Value.,1
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.,0
doesn't last long.,0
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.,0
Thank you for wasting my money.,0
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.,0
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.,1
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.,1
Superb Phone on a Great Network.,1
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.,0
Don't buy this product.,0
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.,0

I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.,0
Waste of 13 bucks.,0
The replacement died in a few weeks.,0
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..,1
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.,1
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.,0
Not impressed.,0
You'll love how thin it is.,1
Bad Choice.,0
The pleather case doesn't fit.,0
All in all I think it was a good investment.,1
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.,0
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.,1
Battery lasts only a few hours.,0
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.,1
Good transmit audio.,1
We are sending it back.,0
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.,0
Great price also!,1
fast service.,1
I would highly recommend this.,1
I would recommend this.,1
WORST PHONE EVER.,0
I'm still infatuated with this phone.,1
Freezes frequently4.,0
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,0
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.,1
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.,1
I'm a bit disappointed.,0
The battery is completely useless to me.,0
What a big waste of time.,0
Don't waste your money on this one.,0
Great sound and service.,1

One of my favorite purchases ever.,1

Worst Customer Service Ever.,0
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.,0
Worth every penny.,1
Excellent wallet type phone case.,1
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!,1
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.,0
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.,1
It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.,1

This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it,0
poor quality and service.,0
Great Earpiece.,1

Great for using with your home stereo.,1
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.,1

Absolutel junk.,0

Returned 8 hours later.,0
It's a great item.,1

Excellent Phone.,1
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.,0
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.,1
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.,1
This one works and was priced right.,1
Customer service was terrible.,0
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.,0
Sending it back.,0
Now I know that I made a wise decision.,1
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.,1
Good price.,1
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.,1
Has been working great.,1
They do not care about the consumer one bit.,0
The instruction manual is lacking.,0
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.,1
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.,1
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.,0
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.,1
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.,1
I want my money back.,0
I love this device.,1
I am also very happy with the price.,1
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.,0
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,0
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.,1
The plug did not work very well.,0
AMAZON SUCKS.,0
VERY comfortable.,1
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.,1
The reception is excellent!,1
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,0
Very disappointing.,0
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.,0
Excellent sound quality.,1
Was not happy.,0
New Battery works great in phone.,1
Worst customer service.,0
Reception is terrible and full of static.,0
Good audio quality.,1
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.,1
Were JERKS on the phone.,0
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.,1
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,0
Excellent starter wireless headset.,0
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,0
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!,0
Nice design and quality.,1
It definitely was not as good as my S11.,1
awesome device.,1
Waste of money.,0
Love This Phone.,1
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.,1
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.,1
Battery life is also great!,1
Not a good item. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.,0
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.,0
Protects the phone on all sides.,1
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.,0
Soyo technology sucks.,0
Great Hands Free Device.,1
Same problem as others have mentioned.,0
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.,1
Magical Help.,1
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.,0
Poor sound quality.,0
It worked very well.,1
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.,1
Exactly what I wanted.,1
This is a great deal.,1
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.,1
Better than you'd expect.,1
Great product and price.,1
what a disappointment,0
Very prompt service.,1
Excellent product for the price.,1
Very pleased with this headset.,1

Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.,1
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.,0
I highly recommend this device to everyone!,1
Jawbone Era is awesome too!,1
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.,0
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.,0
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.,0
Price is good too.,1
Don't make the same mistake I did.,0
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.,0
IT'S REALLY EASY.,1
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,1
Fantastic earphones.,1
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.,1
Low Quality.,0
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.,1
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,0
Very Displeased.,0
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0
Restored my phone to like new performance.,1
Does not fit.,0
Very happy with this product.,1
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,0
Portable and it works.,1
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,0
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0
Timely shipment and quality product.,1
Nice solid keyboard.,1
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.,1
Horrible phone.,0
We would recommend these to others.,1
Cant get the software to work with my computer.,0
poor voice clarity.,0
The battery works great!,1
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.,0
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,0
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,0
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.,0
Great software for Motorolas.,1
The delivery was on time.,1
Very easy to use.,1
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,0
I'd like to return it.,0
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.,1
You won't regret it!,1
A Disappointment.,0
Its not user friendly.,0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0
This PDA rocks.,1
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1
Pretty piece of junk.,0
Plug was the wrong size.,0
Works as described.,1
Bad Purchase.,0
WELL IM SATISFIED.,1
This battery is an excellent bargain!,1
Defective crap.,0
I would have given no star if I was able.,0
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.,1
I would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,0
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,0
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.,1
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!,1
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,1
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,1
REALLY UGLY.,0
The noise shield is incrediable.,1
No real improvement.,0
They refuse to refund or replace.,0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
Great case and price!,1
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,0
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0
I am glad I purchased it.,1
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0
Don't buy this product.,0
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0
Thank you for such great service.,1
Its a total package.,1
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.,0
It's AGGRAVATING!,0
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1
Please dont waste your money.,0
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,0
Disapointing Results.,0
Cumbersome design.,0
Great Product.,1
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,0
This fixes all the problems.,1
Worst ever.,0
I am very happy,1
The battery life is highly unacceptable.,0
That company is a joke.,0
It does everything the description said it would.,1
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,0
Better than expected.,1
Battery is holding up well.,1
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,0
Linked to my phone without effort.,1
THey are so cool!,1
Easy to use.,1
Better Than New.,1
Piece of trash.,0
A pretty good product.,1
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1
Those phones are working just fine now.,1
I am more than happy with this product.,1
Poor Construction.,0
This is infuriating.,0
Sprint charges for this service.,0
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,0
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,1
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0
Poor product.,0
However I needed some better instructions.,0
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,0
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1
Very Dissapointing Performance.,0
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,0
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,1
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1
You get what you pay for I guess.,0
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,1
These are fabulous!,1
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,0
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,0
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1
Great phone.,1
I'm pleased.,1
Battery is terrible.,0
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.,1
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,0
Talk about USELESS customer service.,0
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,0
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,1
Does everything it should and more.,1
I could not recommend these more.,0
Nice Sound.,1
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,1
Setup went very smoothly.,1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0
Truly awful.,0
And none of the tones is acceptable.,0
camera color balance is AWFUL.,0
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,1
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,1
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0
Too bad you have to pay up to money a month for the service!,0
Works well.,1
Clear crisp sound.,1
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,0
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1
It doesn't make you look cool.,0
You can't beat the price on these.,1
lightweight and works well.,1
So just beware.,0
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,0
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,1
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,0
Poor quality.,0
Not worth it.,0
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,0
It was a great phone.,1
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,1
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,1
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,1
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,0
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,1
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,0
Krussel Always good.,1
The design is very good.4.,1
I great reception all the time.,1
I would highly recommend this product.,1
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.,0
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1
Does not fit.,0
disappointing.,0
Blue Ant is easy to use.,1
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,0
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,0
The sound quality is excellent as well.,1
Its the best headset I have used.,1
Would not reccommend.,0
Just what I wanted.,1
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,0
wont work right or atleast for me.,0
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0
Great product.,1
Crisp and Clear.,1
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,0
The reception has been generally good.,1
I highly recommend this case.,1
WORTHWHILE.,1
This is a great deal.,1
I am sorry I made this purchase.,0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0
They work about 2 weeks then break.,0
It is simple to use and I like it.,1
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0
NOT WHAT I WANTED.,0
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,1
Great Phone.,1
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,1
Perfect for the PS3.,1
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,1
$50 Down the drain.,0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,0
For the price this was a great deal.,1
Does Not Work.,0
The reception through this headset is excellent.,1
2 thumbs up to this seller,1
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.,1
Battery has no life.,0
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,0
Product is exactly as described.,1
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.,1
Doesn't do the job.,0
I would recommend it.,1
Plan on ordering from them again and again.,1
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.,1
Awkward to use and unreliable.,0
The shipping time was also very quick!,1
Not as good as I had hoped.,0
Doesn't Work.,0
Really good product.,1
Unfortunately it did not work.,0
All three broke within two months of use.,0
dont buy it.,0
I don't like this Nokia either.,0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,0
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.,0
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.,0
It's not what it says it is.,0
Used and dirty.,0
Not good enough for the price.,0
I bought two of them and neither will charge.,0
It looks very nice.,1
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.,1
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,0
Comfortable in my hand.,1
Just does not work.,0
Poor Reliability.,0
Last time buying from you.,0
It was a waste of my money.,0
So far it has worked like a charm.,1
Would recommend this item.,1
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.,1
The item received was Counterfeit.,0
Works fine.,1
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,1
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.,1
My sister has one also and she loves it.,1
Good Quality.,1
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.,0
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.,0
Having trouble with volume.,0
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,1
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.,0
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.,1
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,0
Excellent product for the price.,1
Bad Reception.,0
It was quite comfortable in the ear.,1
Great phone.,1
Everything about this product is wrong.First,0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1
Terrible phone holder.,0
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,1
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,0
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,0
How stupid is that?,0
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,1
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,1
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,0
Couldn't figure it out,0
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,0
Works for me.,1
much better than the hard plastic cases.,1
It also had a new problem.,0
cool phone.,1
Works good.,1
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,1
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,0
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,0
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,0
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,1
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.,1
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.,1
I'm returning them.,0
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,0
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.,1
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.,1
nice leather.,1
I had to purchase a different case.,0
It is a joy to use.,1
Very much disappointed with this company.,0
Very satisifed with that.,1
It didn't charge for me.,0
Buttons are too small.,0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.,1
Love it.. Great armband.,1
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,1
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.,1
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,1
Also makes it easier to hold on to.,1
It's pretty easy.,1
I cannot make calls at certain places.,0
Beautiful styling though.,1
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.,0
I'm trying to return it for a refund.,0
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,0
Excellent product.,1
Earbud piece breaks easily.,0
Lousy product.,0
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,0
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.,1
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,1
Not enough volume.,0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,0
don't waste your money.,0
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,0
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.,0
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,0
Phone falls out easily.,0
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,0
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.,0
Painful on the ear.,0
Lasted one day and then blew up.,0
disappointed.,0
Kind of flops around.,0
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.,0
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.,0
Item Does Not Match Picture.,0
Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
The fries were great too.,1
A great touch.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
Highly recommended.,1
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
did not like at all.,0
The Burrittos Blah!,0
Service is also cute.,1
So they performed.,1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
This was like the final blow!,0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,1
Ample portions and good prices.,1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,1
Service sucks.,0
The shrimp tender and moist.,1
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
Their chow mein is so good!,1
The portion was huge!,1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
We'd definitely go back here again.,1
We are so glad we found this place.,1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
A great way to finish a great.,1
The service was meh.,0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
This place has it!,1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
Omelets are to die for!,1
Everything was fresh and delicious!,1
say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
We'll never go again.,0
Will be back again!,1
Food arrived quickly!,1
It was not good.,0
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
Will go back next trip out.,1
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,1
Good prices.,1
Check it out.,1
It was pretty gross!,0
I've had better atmosphere.,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.,1
I wouldn't return.,0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,0
Penne vodka excellent!,1
The management is rude.,0
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,1
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
this place is good.,1
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,0
I was seated immediately.,1
Avoid at all cost!,0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,1
I've never been treated so bad.,0
Bacon is hella salty.,1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,0
The waitresses are very friendly.,1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,1
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,0
It was probably dirt.,0
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.,1
Interesting decor.,1
What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.,0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,0
Very friendly staff.,1
It is worth the drive.,1
Food was great and so was the serivce!,1
The warm beer didn't help.,0
Great brunch spot.,1
Service is friendly and inviting.,1
Very good lunch spot.,1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,0
Must have been an off night at this place.,0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.,1
Won't go back.,0
Extremely Tasty!,1
Waitress was good though!,1
Soggy and not good.,0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
Which are small and not worth the price.,0
The service was a bit lacking.,0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
Very very fun chef.,1
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.,1
Now this dish was quite flavourful.,1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,0
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,1
Owner's are really great people.!,1
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,0
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,1
Fantastic service here.,1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.,0
They know how to make them here.,1
very tough and very short on flavor!,0
I hope this place sticks around.,1
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,1
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.,1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!,1
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.,1
You can't beat that.,1
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.,1
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!,1
I think not again,0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.,1
Service stinks here!,0
I waited and waited.,0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,1
Great Pizza and Salads!,1
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.,0
This place is amazing!,1
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!,0
Just don't know why they were so slow.,0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.,1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.,0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.,1
Never again will I be dining at this place!,0
The food was excellent and service was very good.,1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,0
Food was really boring.,0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,0
I did not expect this to be so good!,1
Fantastic food!,1
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.,0
The food was very good.,1
Never going back.,0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.,0
The only downside is the service.,0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,1
You won't be disappointed.,1
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.,0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.,0
Everything was gross.,0
I love this place.,1
Great service and food.,1
There is nothing authentic about this place.,0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,0
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.,1
It's worth driving up from Tucson!,1
Pretty good beer selection too.,1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!,1
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.,0
He was terrible!,0
Everyone is treated equally special.,1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.,0
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!,1
Best fish I've ever had in my life!,1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,0
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.,1
Pretty cool I would say.,1
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.,0
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.,1
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.,0
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.,1
He deserves 5 stars.,1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,0
They dropped more than the ball.,0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.,0
I took back my money and got outta there.,0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.,0
I won't be back.,0
They have great dinners.,1
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.,1
The food was terrible.,0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.,0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.,0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0
This is a disgrace.,0
Def coming back to bowl next time,1
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.,1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.,1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.,0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!,1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.,1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.,1
This one is simply a disappointment.,0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!,0
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.,1
Left very frustrated.,0
I'll definitely be in soon again.,1
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.,1
Service was fantastic.,1
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.,1
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,1
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.,0
But now I was completely grossed out.,0
I really enjoyed eating here.,1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.,1
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,0
What a mistake that was!,0
No complaints!,1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,1
Waiter was a jerk.,0
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.,1
I never come again.,0
Service is quick and friendly.,1
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.,0
So absolutley fantastic.,1
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.,0
definitely will come back here again.,1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,1
Wow very spicy but delicious.,1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.,0
I'd love to go back.,1
Nothing special.,0
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!,1
Will not be back.,0
Sauce was tasteless.,0
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.,1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.,0
Food was so gooodd.,1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,0
I was so insulted.,0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.,0
Best tater tots in the southwest.,1
We loved the place.,1
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.,0
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.,1
The manager was the worst.,0
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.,1
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.,1
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.,0
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.,1
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.,0
Great pork sandwich.,1
Don't waste your time here.,0
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.,1
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.,1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.,1
I LOVED it!,1
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.,0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.,0
The selection of food was not the best.,0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!,1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,0
How awesome is that.,1
I will be back many times soon.,1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!,1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.,1
And then tragedy struck.,0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.,1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.,1
Waitress was sweet and funny.,1
Cant say enough good things about this place.,1
The ambiance was incredible.,1
The waitress and manager are so friendly.,1
I would not recommend this place.,0

My gyro was basically lettuce only.,0
Terrible service!,0
Thoroughly disappointed!,0
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!,1
Reasonably priced also!,1
Everything was perfect the night we were in.,1
The food is very good for your typical bar food.,1
it was a drive to get there.,0
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!,1
first time there and might just be the last.,0
Those burgers were amazing.,1
And it was way to expensive.,0
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.,1
The bartender was also nice.,1
Everything was good and tasty!,1
Terrible management.,0
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.,1
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.,0
Worst martini ever!,0
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.,1
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!,1
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.,1
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.,0
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.,1
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!,1
The desserts were a bit strange.,0
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.,1
Nice ambiance.,1
I would recommend saving room for this!,1
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!,0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.,0
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
I *heart* this place.,1
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.,0
After two I felt disgusting.,0
A good time!,1
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.,1
Generous portions and great taste.,1
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!,0
Food was delicious!,1
I consider this theft.,0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.,0
Waited and waited and waited.,0

I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.,0
Service was good and the company was better!,1
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.,1
Over rated.,0
Their steaks are 100% recommended!,1
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,0
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.,1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.,0
The kids play area is NASTY!,0
Great place fo take out or eat in.,1
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.,1
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.,1
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!,1
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.,1
Not good for the money.,0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!,1
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.,1
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,1
The food is good.,1
It was awesome.,1
I just wanted to leave.,0
I will not be eating there again.,0
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.,0
An absolute must visit!,1
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.,1
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.,0
They really want to make your experience a good one.,1
I will not return.,0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.,0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.,1
Pretty awesome place.,1
Ambience is perfect.,1
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,0
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,1
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!,1
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.,0
We were promptly greeted and seated.,1
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,0
This is a good joint.,1
The Macarons here are insanely good.,1
I'm not eating here!,0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.,0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.,0
Very bad Experience!,0
What a mistake.,0
Food was average at best.,0
Great food.,1
We won't be going back anytime soon!,0
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.,0
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
The patio seating was very comfortable.,1
The fried rice was dry as well.,0
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!,1
It was just not a fun experience.,1
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.,1
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.,1
Both great!,1
Eclectic selection.,1
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.,1
The staff was very attentive.,1
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.,0
dont go here.,0
I promise they won't disappoint.,1
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.,0
What a great double cheeseburger!,1
Awesome service and food.,1
I can't wait to go back.,1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.,0

Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.,0

Total brunch fail.,0
It was absolutely amazing.,1
will definitely be back!,1
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.,1
I was mortified.,0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.,0
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.,1
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,1
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,0
The atmosphere here is fun.,1
Would not recommend to others.,0
Not my thing.,0
If you are reading this please don't go there.,0
They have a really nice atmosphere.,1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,0
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.,1
Awesome selection of beer.,1
Great food and awesome service!,1
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.,1
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.,0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.,1
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.,1
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.,1
Never had anything to complain about here.,1
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.,1
It was way over fried.,0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
Will not be back!,0
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.,1
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.,1
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.,1
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!,1
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.,0
This is a GREAT place to eat!,1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.,1
The service was poor and thats being nice.,0
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!,0
But the service was beyond bad.,0
Tasted like dirt.,0
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .,1
The block was amazing.,1
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!,1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.,0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!,1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.,0
These were so good we ordered them twice.,1
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.,0
I had a pretty satifying experience.,1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.,1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.,0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!,1
We will not be coming back.,0
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1
Once your food arrives it's meh.,0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,1
Mediocre food.,0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.,1
I'm super pissd.,0
And service was super friendly.,1
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?,0
This place was such a nice surprise!,1
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0
The service was terrible though.,0
I love this place.,1
I can say that the desserts were yummy.,1
The food was terrible.,0
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.,1
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.,0
This place should honestly be blown up.,0
But I definitely would not eat here again.,0
Do not waste your money here!,0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.,1
Awful service.,0
Won't ever go here again.,0
Food quality has been horrible.,0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,0
The service here is fair at best.,0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.,0
Very poor service.,0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,0
They were excellent.,1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!,1
The food came out at a good pace.,1
I won't be back.,0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,0
This place deserves no stars.,0
I would not recommend this place.,0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
I probably would not go here again.,0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.,1
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,1
I probably won't be coming back here.,0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.,0
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,1
I love their fries and their beans.,1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.,1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.,1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,1
Weird vibe from owners.,0
There was hardly any meat.,0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.,0
Go To Place for Gyros.,1
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.,1
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
The service was extremely slow.,0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.,1
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,0
Worst Thai ever.,0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1
The pizza selections are good.,1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0
Spend your money elsewhere.,0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
We won't be returning.,0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.,0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
This place is disgusting!,0
The RI style calamari was a joke.,0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
Disappointing experience.,0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
Don't bother coming here.,0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
But then they came back cold.,0
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
The food wasn't good.,0
Overpriced for what you are getting.,0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
Food was below average.,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Spend your money and time some place else.,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
the presentation of the food was awful.,0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0
Appetite instantly gone.,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0
Very little music or anything to speak of.,0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.,1
Wasted two hours.,0
A bit predictable.,0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.,1
And those baby owls were adorable.,1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.,1
It Was So Cool.,1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.,1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?,1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.,0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.,0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.,1
It deserves strong love.,1
It is an insane game.,1
Waste your money on this game.,1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.,1
Today the graphics are crap.,0
This game rocks.,1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.,1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.,0
I wasn't the least bit interested.,0
But it's just not funny.,0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.,0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.,0
Totally believable.,1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.,1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.,1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.,1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.,1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.,1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.,1
I was very disappointed in the movie.,0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.,0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.,0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.,0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.,0
There are some generally great things in it.,1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.,1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.,1
Give this one a look.,1
I gave it a 10,1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.,1
It is a true classic.,1
Definitely worth checking out.,1
The problem was the script.,0
It was horrendous.,0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.,0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.,0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.,1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.,1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.,1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.,1
I don't think you will be disappointed.,1
Too politically correct.,0
Very disappointing.,0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.,0
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.,1
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.,0
The directing seems too pretentious.,0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.,0
I really liked that.,1
A great film by a great director.,1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.,1
The music in the film is really nice too.,1
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.,1
Brilliant!,1
I liked this movie way too much.,1
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.,0
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.,1
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.,0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.,0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.,0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.,0
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.,1
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.,0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.,0
I paid too much.,0
It was so BORING!,0
No plot whatsoever!,0
Horrible!,0
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!,0
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!,0
I hate movies like that.,0
Awful.,0
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.,0
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.,0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.,0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.,0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.,0
I mean this in a terrible way.,0
This film has no redeeming features.,0
Everything is appalling.,0
The story is beyond stupid.,0
The kids are annoying.,0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.,0
Highly unrecommended.,0
Nothing at all to recommend.,0
An excellent performance from Ms.,1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.,1
There were too many close ups.,0
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.,0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.,0
This movie is BAD.,0
So bad.,0
The film is way too long.,0
This is definitely one of the bad ones.,0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.,1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.,1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.,1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.,1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.,0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.,1
His performance is simply genius.,1
Ray Charles is legendary.,1
Hitchcock is a great director.,1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.,0
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.,0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.,0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.,0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.,0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.,0
The character developments also lacked in depth.,0
Do not waste your time.,0
It was just too horrible.,0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.,0
The poor actors.,0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.,0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.,0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.,0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.,0
The dialogue sucked.,0
The soundtrack sucked.,0
The acting sucked.,0
The concert sequences just sucked.,0
That was nice.,1
That was funny.,1
It was so funny.,1
I came out of it feeling angry.,0
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.,1
Up there with the best of Melville.,1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.,1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.,1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.,1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.,0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.,0
There is a lot of beautiful places.,1
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.,0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.,0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.,0
The acting was bad.,0
Really bad.,0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!,1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.,1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.,1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.,1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.,1
I literally vomited while watching this film.,0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.,1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.,1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.,1
This is such a fun and funny movie.,1
Highly entertaining at all angles.,1
It even has its sweet moments.,1
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.,1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.,1
And I really did find them funny.,1
This is actually a very smart movie.,1
There is a brilliant twist ending.,1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.,1
I will never forget it now.,1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.,0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.,0
This movie is terrible.,0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!,0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.,0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.,0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.,0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.,0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.,0
Glad I didn't pay to see it.,0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.,0
It is a really good show to watch.,1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.,1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.,1
is pretty funny.,1
Babie Bop is very cute.,1
The kids are very cool too.,1
It's just lame.,0
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.,0
Everything about this movie is stupid.,0
It is shameful.,0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.,1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.,1
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!,1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.,1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.,1
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.,1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.,1
Definitely worth checking out.,1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.,1
This movie has a cutting edge to it.,1
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.,0
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.,0
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.,0
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.,1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!,0
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.,0
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.,0
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.,1
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.,1
This is high adventure at its best.,1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.,1
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.,0
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.,1
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.,1
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.,1
I rather enjoyed it.,1
I liked it.,1
I couldn't take them seriously.,0
It really created a unique feeling though.,1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.,1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.,1
Her role was played well.,1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.,1
The camera really likes her in this movie.,1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.,1
Even worse than Ticker!,0
& That movie was bad.,0
It just blew.,0
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.,0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.,0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.,0
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.,1
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.,1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.,1
Not even good for camp value!,0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.,0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!,0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.,0
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.,0
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.,1
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.,1
Even the squibs look awful.,0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.,0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.,0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.,0
The directing is sloppy at best.,0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.,0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.,0
But this movie really got to me.,1
See it.,1
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.,1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.,1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.,1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.,1
The rest of the cast also play well.,1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.,1
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.,0
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.,0
What this film lacks is a convincing script.,0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.,0
The cast is good.,1
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.,0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.,0
Everything about it is just bad.,0
It is zillion times away from reality.,0
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.,0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!,0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.,0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!,0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.,0
the cast was great.,1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.,0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.,0
there is no real plot.,0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.,0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.,1
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.,0
This may be the only bad film he ever made.,0
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.,0
I thought it was bad.,0
The script is a big flawed mess.,0
The movie is terribly boring in places.,0
The lighting is awful.,0
The film looks cheap and bland.,0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.,0
The visual effects were AWFUL.,0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!,0
Not recommended.,0
The budget was evidently very limited.,0
Filmiing was less expansive.,0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.,0
Generally; it just lacked imagination.,0
Not recommended.,0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?,0
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.,0
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!,0
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!,0
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.,1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.,1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.,1
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.,1
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.,0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.,0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?,0
The story line is just awful!,0
It's just painful!,0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!,0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.,0
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.,1
Go watch it!,1
Omit watching this.,0
VERY funny!,1
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.,1
Don't miss it.,1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.,0
Avoid at all costs.,0
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!,1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!,1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.,1
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!,1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.,1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!,1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.,1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.,1
The cast is always entertaining as usual.,1
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.,0
The least said about the acting the better.,0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.,1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.,1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.,1
Excellent performance.,1
There still are good actors around!,1
Also great directing and photography.,1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.,1
It is not good.,0
Then the film just dropped the ball.,0
This is a stunning movie.,1
Raw and sublimely moving.,1
All of the main players are mesmerising.,1
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.,1
He's a national treasure.,1
GO AND SEE IT!,1
This is an excellent film.,1
It was also the right balance of war and love.,1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.,1
A good film by a great director!,1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.,1
This is just a great movie.,1
10 out of 10 stars.,1
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.,0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.,0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.,1
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.,1
I advise you to look out for it.,1
You wont regret it!,1
Highly recommended A+,1
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.,0
How awful she is!,0
DELETE this film from your mind!,0
One of the worst shows of all time.,0
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.,0
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.,0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.,0
Lame would be the best way to describe it.,0
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.,1
You can find better movies at youtube.,0
It will drive you barking mad!,0
The transfers are very good.,1
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.,1
Nothing new there.,0
That was done in the second movie.,0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.,0
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.,0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?,0
I just saw this film and I recommend it.,1
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.,0
But I thought his acting was skilled.,1
Meredith M was better than all right.,1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.,1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.,1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.,1
A standout scene.,1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.,0
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.,1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.,1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.,1
This movie is also revealing.,1
And it was boring.,0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.,1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.,1
You won't forget this movie!,1
Why was this film made?,0
The result is a film that just don't look right.,0
None of them are engaging or exciting.,0
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.,0
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.,0
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.,1
This movie is so awesome!,1
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.,1
If you want a real scare rent this one!,1
This is an extraordinary film.,1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.,1
She carries the movie well.,1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.,1
Avoid at ALL costs!,0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.,0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.,0
The worst one of the series.,0
This film offers many delights and surprises.,1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.,1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.,1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.,1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.,1
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.,1
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.,1
See both films if you can.,1
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.,0
It's very slow.,0
Don't waste your time.,0
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.,0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.,0
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.,0
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.,1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.,1
Lots of holes in the script.,0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.,0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.,0
The dialogue is atrocious.,0
The acting is beyond abysmal.,0
Everything stinks.,0
A film not easily forgotten.,1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.,1
Great movie!,1
Also the story and acting were weak.,0
The script is horrendously stupid.,0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.,0
What the hell kind of crap is that?!,0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!,0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.,1
She's poised and amazing.,1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.,0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.,0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.,0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.,0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.,0
Avoid at any and all costs.,0
Avoid this film at all costs.,0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.,0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.,0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.,0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.,0
This one just fails to create any real suspense.,0
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.,0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.,0
Hated it.,0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.,0
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.,0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.,1
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.,1
Excellent short film.,1
The story line is totally predictable.,0
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.,0
Really awful.,0
Not easy to watch.,0
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.,1
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.,1
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.,1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.,1
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.,1
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.,1
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.,1
Go rent it.,1
Brilliance indeed.,1
Think of the film being like a dream.,1
Simply beautiful.,1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.,1
The movie seemed a little slow at first.,0
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.,1
I enjoyed it.,1
I have recommended it to friends.,1
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.,1
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.,1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.,1
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.,1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.,1
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!,1
I keep watching it over and over.,1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.,1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.,1
Lange had become a great actress.,1
It looked like a wonderful story.,1
I never walked out of a movie faster.,0
